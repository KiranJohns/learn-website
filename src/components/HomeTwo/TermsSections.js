                        acknowledge that you are agreeing to be bound by these terms and conditions by using any of our
                        services.</p>

                        agreements on behalf of the Customer. You also agree that these Terms and Conditions will take

                        for the ordering of such services.</p>

                    <p>2.3 If a customer has a specific contract or agreement in place for alternative services offered by
                        Learn for Care, the Customer agrees that these Terms and Conditions will apply for any training or
                        consultancy services unless Learn for Care specifically acknowledges this in writing. This is especially
                        true for situations where there is a conflict between terms and conditions.</p>

                    <p>
                        2.4 Learn for Care has the right to change these terms of service at any time and without notice.

                    <p>
                        2.5 If the customer rejects any modifications, they must tell Learn for Care right away. If this is the
                        case, the previous T&amp;Cs will apply for the balance of the Agreement, and the updated.

                    <p>
                        2.6 Learn for Care will always use reasonable care and skill to deliver the Services that are requested

                        2.8 Everybody involved is an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement will establish an
                        agency, joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement of that kind between the parties. It is
                        forbidden for one party to represent the other as a partner, employee, franchisee, agent, or legal
                        representative.

                    <p>
                        2.9 Learn for Care may, in whole or in part, delegate or subcontract to a capable third party its duties
                        or rights under this Agreement. This Agreement may not be transferred by the Customer in whole or
                        in part without Learn for Care prior authorization in writing.

                    <p>2.11. Oxford Care Services does not, under any circumstances, offer refunds, credits, or anything
                        similar for online course purchases once payment has been approved or cleared.</p>

                    <p>2.12. Unauthorised access, use, or loss of courses do not subject Oxford Care Services to liability. It is
                        the client&#39;s responsibility to safeguard their Learning Connect account access.</p>

                    <p>2.13. The client understands that Learn for Care is an online resource provider and that they must
                        make sure users have the necessary tools and assistance to use online learning. Any associated
                        problems are not Oxford Care Services&#39; fault.</p>

                    <p>2.14. The user is in charge of planning and overseeing their use of the materials provided by Learn
                        for Care, including any course fees associated with their account(s).</p>

                    <p>2.15. If the client opts in and has an active account with Learn for Care, they may get unsolicited
                        emails on pertinent activity that Learn for Care determines</p>

                        safety requirements, so long as the modifications don&#39;t materially impair the products&#39; functionality
                        or quality.</p>

                    <p>2.18. Learn for Care issues certificates based on responses supplied by users. Learn for Care makes
                        no guarantees about the user&#39;s comprehension of the material; this is the customer&#39;s obligation.</p>

                    <p>
                        2.19. The online service may occasionally experience outages due to routine upgrades and
                        maintenance; Learn for Care will try to notify users in advance wherever practical.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        2.20. Unplanned outages that are outside of Learn for Care control do occasionally occur. They will
                        do their best to promptly restore access, but they cannot be held responsible for any unavailability
                        resulting from events beyond of their reasonable control. This section emphasises that Learn for
                        Care accepts the risk of unanticipated situations or occurrences that might cause brief service
                        interruptions or unavailability. Even while they will make every effort to reduce downtime and
                        swiftly restore access, they cannot be held accountable for events beyond their control.
                    </p>
